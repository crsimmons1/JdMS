Our files:
1. **Data Cleaning**: creating the cleaned dataset, quality assurance, and modifying the data frame.
- export the data (short format) as cleaned_data.pkl

2. **Data Visualization**: creating graphs to show relationships/trends not related to the model.

3. **Model**: this is the actual segmentation model used to find our clusters to gain further insights.

Over the course of the project we will add notes about the files of the project and what we are doing.
