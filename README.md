Our files:
1. **DataCleaning.ipynb**: creating the cleaned dataset, quality assurance, and modifying the data frame. Export the clean data as:
- export the data (long format) as cleaned_data.pkl
- export the data (wide format) as customer_data.pkl

2. **DataVisualization.ipynb**: creating graphs to show relationships/trends not related to the model.

3. **Kmeans.ipynb**: this is the segmentation model that utilizes k-means to find our clusters.

4. **MeanShift.ipynb**: this is the segmentation model that utilizes mean shift to find our clusters.

4. **DBSCAN.ipynb**: this is the segmentation model that utilizes DBSCAN to find our clusters.

Over the course of the project we will add notes about the files of the project and what we are doing.
